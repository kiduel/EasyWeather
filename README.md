Easy Weather app

4 hours was a very short time. 

The application gets the current city location and displays the currnet weather of the city.
In additon,  just below the current weather, weather for the current 5 days is displayed.
I did the basic requirments and used icon on the a receycler view. 

The following is a list of things that need cleaning up:
* Comments are lacking
* No error checking

If I had more time, I would have
* implemented the search funtionality
* created degre conversion machanisim
* created better layout for horizotal orientation
and so on...

and if I even had more time, I would have added nav drawer and settings and much more.
