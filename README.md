Easy Weather app

**When testing the app, please use API level which is below 28. According to the documentation. "Starting with Android 9.0 (API level 28), cleartext support is disabled by default" - For more information, please read the following disucssion, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45940861/android-8-cleartext-http-traffic-not-permitted**

4 hours was a very short time. 

The application gets the current city location and displays the current weather of the city.
In addition,  just below the current weather, weather for the current 5 days is displayed.
I did the basic requirements and used icon on the a recycler view. 

The following is a list of things that need cleaning up:
* Comments are lacking
* No error checking

If I had more time, I would have
* implemented the search functionality
* created degree conversion mechanism
* created better layout for horizontal orientation
and so on...

and if I even had more time, I would have added nav drawer and settings and much more.
